      <p>My name is Santi Arroyo. I grew up living all around the US and in Spain. For the majority of my adult life I have lived in New Jersey and Massachusetts. I attended Berklee School of Music for college. I am passionate about music, comedy, movies, and video games. I hope to mix my passion for coding and the comedy in my future career.
            <br/> <br/>
            I became interested in coding during COVID while I was working as a teacher. I started playing around with free online programs, such as, 100 days of coding and codecademy. While coding is a very difficult task, I enjoy the creativity it allows me to employ. I look forward to expanding my knowledge during this boot camp and creating more projects.
